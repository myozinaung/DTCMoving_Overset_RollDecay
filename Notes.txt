DTCHullMoving_Overset(v2312) --> Roll Decay Test (DTC Paper)

Modifications:

- Half to Full Model
- Adjust CG location and moment of inertia
- Release 6DOF
- Pre Roll and heave equilibrium before test (meshMove)
- For zero speed, no Inlet/Outlet, noSlip Wall?????
- Change the tank size


- added renumberMesh after Merging (not necessary)
- added shell script to move oversetHull to the top (above atmosphere) in constant/polyMesh/boundary

hull/
blockMeshDict
- increase ymax to get fullwidth (no symmetry)
- removed mid symmetry plane
- added mid symmetry plane faces to oversetHull
- blocks: yCells 20 to 40

snappyHexMeshDict
- need to adjust locationInMesh to make sure the mesh is inside the mesh

background/
0/U
- change U to 0 m/s

blockMeshDict
- increase ymax to get fullwidth (no symmetry)
- no need to remove mid symmetry plane
- blocks: yCells 19 to 38 (all blocks)

dynamicMeshDict
- removed restraints
- added Px, Py and Rx, Rz in joints OR change composite to floating, removed joints
- double mass and inertia

snappyHexMeshDict
- BoxRefinement_1 increase ymax to get fullwidth (no symmetry)

topsetDicts(All)
- increase ymax to get fullwidth (no symmetry)
