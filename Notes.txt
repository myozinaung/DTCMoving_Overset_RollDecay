DTCHullMoving_Overset(v2312) --> Roll Decay Test (DTC Paper)

Modifications:

- Half to Full Model >> finished
- Adjust CG location and moment of inertia >> finished
- Release 6DOF (change joints to floating???) >> finished
- Pre Roll (roatate-angle) >> finished
- heave equilibrium (translate) >> finished
- For zero speed, no Inlet/Outlet, noSlip Wall or symmetry????? >> finished
- Change the tank size >> finished (not same size as Cadence Webinar)
- remove damping restraints >> finished
- no accelerationDamping and accelerationRelaxation >> finished
- fvOptions velocityDampingConstraint remove??? >> finished

- Rotate and translate using transform in dynamicMeshDict???

Mesh Improvement:
- More Inflation layers
- More refinement near the hull
- Wave damping zone


- added renumberMesh after Merging (not necessary)
- added shell script to move oversetHull to the top (above atmosphere) in constant/polyMesh/boundary

hull/
blockMeshDict
- increase ymax to get fullwidth (no symmetry)
- removed mid symmetry plane
- added mid symmetry plane faces to oversetHull
- blocks: yCells 20 to 40

snappyHexMeshDict
- need to adjust locationInMesh to make sure the mesh is inside the mesh

background/
0/U
- change U to 0 m/s (no need if Inlet/Outlet are symmetry)

blockMeshDict
- increase ymax to get fullwidth (no symmetry)
- no need to remove mid symmetry plane
- blocks: yCells 19 to 38 (all blocks)
- Adjust xmin and xmax so that the ship is in the middle of the domain

dynamicMeshDict
- removed restraints
- added Px, Py and Rx, Rz in joints OR change composite to floating, removed joints
- double mass and inertia

snappyHexMeshDict (not used)
- BoxRefinement_1 increase ymax to get fullwidth (no symmetry)

topsetDicts(All)
- increase ymax to get fullwidth (no symmetry)
